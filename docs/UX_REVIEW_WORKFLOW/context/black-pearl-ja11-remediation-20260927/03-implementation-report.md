# Implementation report - Black Pearl and JA11 remediation

Status: SOFTWARE_VERIFIED; release status is
`MERGE_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` because the trusted signed-beta workflow is main-only.

## Implementation result

### TRN Black Pearl Direct Flash

- Preserved the existing protocol bytes, report order, timing, gain math, identity matching, and
  authoritative session ownership.
- Preserved the existing complete ten-band/latch/Flash sequence and existing verified compact copy:
  `Flash successful · TRN Black Pearl EQ was saved and verified · Final hardware readback matched.`
- Success still requires active-slot/gain baseline, representable expected native bands, current
  session before and during writes, all ten native fields matching in raw wire-domain values, raw
  global-gain equality, and valid final session state.
- A readable mismatched final gain now reconciles the persisted anti-stacking delta to
  `observedFinalGainRaw - baselineGainRaw`; it returns `VerificationFailed`, never success, and
  never rewrites automatically.
- Missing/malformed band or gain readback, session replacement, or final uncertainty marks the
  anti-stacking baseline unknown. Later Flash/Reset refuses mutation until a complete fresh
  authoritative snapshot establishes a zero app-owned delta baseline.

### FiiO JA11 My DAC -> EQ

- Added a discoverable `Edit EQ` action in the existing current-hardware EQ section. It is enabled
  only for connected/current-session User 1, matching device/EQ snapshot generation, fresh current
  five-band readback, native global EQ gain, no active read/restart/operation, and an implemented
  route.
- Off and Vocal/Classic/Bass remain truthful non-editable states; no User 1 coefficients are shown
  as their current acoustic response.
- Added one immutable editor baseline token containing exact transport identity/product,
  session generation, active User 1, all five native bands, native global-gain units, freshness,
  and verification time.
- Opening, editing, reset-local-edits, Review, Cancel, Close, and Back are local/read-only. Review
  presents all five type/frequency/gain/Q values, planned global EQ gain, response/headroom
  consequences, warnings, and that Apply is the first hardware write.
- Apply is accepted only from Review with changes, no blocking issue, safe headroom, and a baseline
  token. It re-reads the complete User 1/bands/global-gain token immediately before the first
  write even when USB generation is unchanged, then uses the exact five-band -> global gain -> User
  1 -> Apply -> volatile readback -> one Save/reconnect -> final readback sequence.
- A stale token, disconnect, timeout, transfer failure, mismatched readback, or replacement session
  is not success and does not retry. Existing operation trace fields record `EDITOR_APPLY`, target
  bands, save count, phases, identity, and state-known/unknown outcome.
- JA11 global-gain fingerprint representation is corrected to the maintained signed tenths-dB
  domain. Protocol wire bytes and the existing qualified transaction codec are unchanged; tests
  prove the editor uses the same quantized command path.

## Changed files

Production changes are limited to the shared Black Pearl gain-state guardrail, JA11 snapshot/editor
domain and transaction boundary, existing Hardware EQ repository/session plumbing, existing My DAC
screen/action wiring, and four review strings. Test changes add Black Pearl failure-safety,
JA11 transaction, snapshot-unit, editor, presentation, and Edit-action state coverage. Durable run
artifacts are in this folder. Maintained documentation changes are limited to the changelog,
My DAC status, and release-readiness audit.

No protocol, transport, USB identity, endpoint, retry, canonical EQ, navigation, or unsupported
hardware-control file was changed.

## Validation matrix

Commands were run in the isolated worktree with the checked-in wrapper tooling.

- `node /Users/stephenweeks/.agents/skills/unlazy/scripts/gate-lint.mjs docs/UX_REVIEW_WORKFLOW/context/black-pearl-ja11-remediation-20260927/GATES.md` - PASS, `LINT OK`.
- `./tools/codex-android :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests '*BlackPearl*' --tests '*FiioJa11*'` - PASS; focused tests completed successfully. The later state-matrix test was included in the complete suite.
- `./tools/codex-android :app:testDebugUnitTest` - PASS, `UNIT_TESTS_PASS`.
- `./tools/codex-android :app:lintDebug :app:assembleDebug` - PASS, `LINT_ASSEMBLE_PASS`; lint report at `app/build/reports/lint-results-debug.html`. Only existing/deprecation/packaging warnings were reported; no new error.
- `./tools/codex-android :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest` - PASS, `EMULATOR_INSTRUMENTATION_PASS`; 20 tests on `codex-api36(AVD)`.
- `git diff --check` - PASS.
- Deterministic fake transports - PASS through the focused/full unit suite; no USB hardware transport was invoked.
- Release/R8/security/CodeQL/remote CI - NOT RUN locally where not available; no claim is made from their absence.

## Emulator and app smoke evidence

- AVD: `codex-api36`; device serial: `emulator-5554`; API level: `36`; model: `sdk_gphone64_arm64`.
- `adb devices -l` reported the device ready and `getprop sys.boot_completed` returned `1`.
- Debug APK install succeeded from `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
- Cold launch succeeded twice with `am start -W -n com.weekssa.opraeqforuapp/.MainActivity` and
  `Status: ok`, `LaunchState: COLD`.
- Large-text smoke used `settings put system font_scale 1.3`, force-stop, and cold launch; the
  launch remained successful. Font scale was restored to `1.0`.
- `uiautomator dump` succeeded and exposed readable My EQs, EQ Library, Settings, Import, and
  empty-state labels in the Compose hierarchy. This is software accessibility smoke evidence, not
  a TalkBack certification.
- The two pre-install uninstall attempts returned `DELETE_FAILED_INTERNAL_ERROR`; the non-`-r`
  install then succeeded and no signature-conflicting package blocked installation. This was a
  disposable emulator only.
- Debug APK SHA-256 observed from the final gate-run assembly: `24785132fe18e7fd9b92a5a197b07175569c96b6eea768f7e79c73f6b24a9e45`.
  It is an unsigned/debug development artifact, not the signed beta candidate.

## Signed candidate provenance

- Signed beta workflow: `.github/workflows/signed-beta.yml`.
- Result: no signed candidate produced for this branch.
- Exact boundary: job condition requires `github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`; candidate input options
  are only `ja11` and `ew300`, not a combined Black Pearl + JA11 target.
- Therefore APK filename, signed APK SHA-256, signer certificate, workflow run, immutable artifact
  ID/digest, and signed install evidence are `NOT AVAILABLE` for this branch. No debug APK is
  presented as a beta or physical-test candidate.

## Hardware boundary

Luna did not connect to, mutate, Flash, Apply, Reset, Save, Restore, or otherwise write any DAC.
No physical result is claimed. The next routine owner intervention can occur only after the
owner-controlled trusted-main signing boundary produces an exact combined candidate.
